# BUILDING THE PROJECT
<pre>
build & build-cmake files are included
    .sh  extension is for linux
    .bat extension is for windows

only build.bat works correctly

build.bat,      creates Visual Studio Solution
build-cmake.bat creates mingw-w64 makefiles for windows

If you want to use makefiles in windows you have to change the linked library directory for glfw3 in CMakeLists.txt

*Linux build is not working
